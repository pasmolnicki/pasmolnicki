## About Me
Practitioner of selectively applied software enthusiasm. I assemble small, questionably coherent systems that somehow converge on usefulness (eventually, given sufficient retries and cache invalidations). Any resemblance to a long‑term roadmap is emergent behavior.

I optimize for: clarity (rare), brevity (aspirational), and the quiet satisfaction of deleting code that once felt essential. I refactor preemptively, then pretend it was reactive. I also like churros (domain‑specific carbohydrates supporting sustained debugging throughput).

**Favorite Languages (measured in stubbornness, not utility)**

Underlying stack: a loosely coupled mesh of half‑documented micro‑ideas, synchronized via TODO comments and caffeine. Architectural strategy: deliberate under‑specification to preserve optionality (and plausible deniability). Some components may be imaginary; this is a feature, not a defect.

**Miscellaneous Signal Leakage**

Meta objective: maintain a sustainable ratio of shipped artifacts to philosophical digressions about build determinism. Occasionally I succeed. Undefined behavior is treated as a creative collaborator.

**Selected Projects (non-exhaustive, reality adjacent)**
- [EStation](https://github.com/pasmolnicki/EStation) 
- [Mondelez](https://github.com/pasmolnicki/go-mcts)
- [CLife](https://github.com/pasmolnicki/CLife)
- [Chess-Engine](https://github.com/pasmolnicki/Chess-Engine)

If any of this sounds confusing, it’s working as designed. If it sounds normal, we may already be in the same debugger session.
