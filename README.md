## About Me
Practitioner of selectively applied software enthusiasm. Currently engrossing myself in studies, enforced by the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I assemble small, questionably coherent systems that somehow converge on usefulness (eventually, given sufficient retries and cache invalidations). Any resemblance to a long‑term roadmap is emergent behavior.

I optimize for: clarity (rare), brevity (aspirational), and the quiet satisfaction of deleting code that once felt essential. I refactor preemptively, then pretend it was reactive.

**Favorite Languages (measured in stubbornness, not utility)**

Underlying stack: a loosely coupled mesh of half‑documented micro‑ideas, synchronized via TODO comments and caffeine. Architectural strategy: deliberate under‑specification to preserve optionality (and plausible deniability). Some components may be imaginary; this is a feature, not a defect.

**Selected Projects (non-exhaustive, reality adjacent)**
- [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Node.js](https://github.com/pasmolnicki/uttt-react) - can be found [here](https://uttt.up.railway.app)

If any of this sounds confusing, it’s working as designed.
